Submitting a patch
==================

There is no purpose on rewriting `this <http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/patches.html>`_.

It's just perfect check list so please follow it, while creating patch for Sylius.

The only difference is that instead of tagging pull requests with *[Component]*, just send the pull request to correct repository.
Most of the time, this repository will be Sylius/Sylius, since the other repositories are read-only sub-tree splits.
