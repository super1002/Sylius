Submitting a patch
==================

There is no purpose on rewriting `this <http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/patches.html>`_.

It's just perfect check list so please follow it, while creating patch for Sylius.

The only difference is that instead of tagging pull requests with *[Component]*, just send the pull request to correct repository.
