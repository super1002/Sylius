Reporting a bug
===============

All bundles and Sylius itself, uses **GitHub issues** for bug tracking.
If you have found a bug, please create an issue for correct repository.

Before submitting a bug:

 * Double-check the official `documentation <http://docs.sylius.com>`_ to see if you're not misusing the
   bundle or Sylius;

 * Ask for assistance on the `users mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/sylius>`_, or on the
   #sylius `IRC channel <irc://irc.freenode.net/sylius>`_ if you're not sure if your issue is really a bug.

If your problem definitely looks like a bug, report it using the **GitHub** issues.

 * Use the title field to clearly describe the issue;

 * Describe the steps needed to reproduce the bug with short code examples
   (providing a unit test that illustrates the bug is best);

 * Give as much details as possible about your environment (OS, PHP version,
   Symfony version, Sylius version, enabled extensions, ...);

 * *(optional)* Attach a :doc:`patch <patches>`.
