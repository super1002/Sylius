Symfony
=======

Sylius is built on top of `Symfony2`_, a modern framework for PHP. If you are
familiar with this tool, you can safely skip this quick introduction. You
should feel like home when working with Sylius.

HTTP Fundamentals
-----------------

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a text language that allows two machines
to communicate with each other. Symfony2 is built from the ground-up around
this protocol.

Each time any client wants to access Sylius store page, it all starts with a
*request*. This text message, created by the browser, is sent to a server,
which should return a proper response.

In HTTP, the message can look something like this:

.. code-block:: text

    GET /products HTTP/1.1
    Host: sylius.org
    Accept: text/html
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh)

The URI (e.g. ``/`` or ``/products/nike-t-shirt``) is the unique location that
identifies the resource the client wants. The HTTP tells the app what client
wants to *do* with the resource.

The HTTP methods are the *verbs* of the request and define the few common ways
that you can act upon the resource:

+----------+---------------------------------------+
| *GET*    | Retrieve the resource from the server |
+----------+---------------------------------------+
| *POST*   | Create a resource on the server       |
+----------+---------------------------------------+
| *PUT*    | Update the resource on the server     |
+----------+---------------------------------------+
| *DELETE* | Delete the resource from the server   |
+----------+---------------------------------------+

An example HTTP request to delete a specific product might look like:

.. code-block:: text

    DELETE /products/15 HTTP/1.1

Based on the request, the server will return a response.

.. code-block:: text

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Sat, 03 Apr 2013 22:25:05 GMT
    Server: lighttpd/1.4.19
    Content-Type: text/html

    <html>
        <!-- Interesting content! -->
    </html>

Controllers
-----------

A controller is a PHP function that you create that takes information from the
HTTP request, then constructs and returns an HTTP response. The response
could be an HTML page representing a product, an XML document with all
informations about particular order, a serialized JSON product representation,
an image, a redirect, a 404 error, etc.

The following controller would render a page that simply prints ``Hello world!``::

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

    // ...
    public function helloAction()
    {
        return new Response('Hello world!');
    }

Every page you see in Sylius store is a result of controller action. When you
view a product page, list all products or display login form, it's always a
result of this simple schema, where *controller creates a Response based on
current Request*.

Routing

Final Thoughts
--------------

Symfony2 is very flexible web application framework. To work with Sylius you
need to know only the fundamentals, but it is recommended to learn more about
this awesome tool. It will give you better understanding of Sylius internals,
and allow you to create really advanced e-commerce projects on top of that
knowledge.
