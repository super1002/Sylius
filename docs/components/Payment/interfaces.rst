.. _component_payment_model_payments-subject-interface:

PaymentsSubjectInterface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any container which manages multiple payments should implement this interface.

but instead chooses another calculator (from a registry etc.) to do the calculation, and then returns the result.

.. note::
   For more detailed information go to `Sylius API DelegatingFeeCalculatorInterface`_.

.. _Sylius API DelegatingFeeCalculatorInterface: http://api.sylius.org/Sylius/Component/Payment/Calculator/DelegatingFeeCalculatorInterface.html

.. _component_payment_repository_payment-method-repository-interface:

PaymentMethodRepositoryInterface
