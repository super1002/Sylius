Deployment
==========

Development usually takes most of the time in project implementation, but we should not forget about what's at the end of this process -
application deployment into the server. We believe, that it should be as easy and understandable as possible.
There are many servers which you can choose for your store deployment, but in this chapter, we will use `Platform.sh <https://platform.sh/>`_.

.. attention::

    To deploy your application to the proposed server, you need to have a git repository configured.

Process
-------

For example there is configuration for Platform.sh : :doc:`Deployment platform.sh </cookbook/deployment/platform-sh>`

You have also a URL provided, which you can visit to see if your shop working well. Of course, it does not have your configuration
done locally, as well as your product... but you have an application deployed! Congratulations! You've just finished the first
stage of the first project with Sylius.

.. important::

    Of course, using the **Platform.sh** is only an example. You can use any server you want or you're familiar with.
