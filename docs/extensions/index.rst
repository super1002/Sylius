Sylius Extensions
=================

Sylius as a platform has a lot of space for various customizations and extensions. It aims to provide a simple schema for
developing extensions (plugins). Anything you can imagine can be implemented and added to the Sylius framework as an extension.

What are the extensions for?
----------------------------

The extensions (or Plugins like some call them) are Symfony Bundles that either modify or extend Sylius default behaviour,
providing useful features that are built on top of the Sylius Core.

Exemplary features may be: Social media buttons, newsletter, wishlists etc.

Extension Development Flow
--------------------------

Since Sylius is an open-source platform, there is a certain flow in order for the extension to become officially adopted by the community.

**1.** Develop the extension using :doc:`the official Extension Development guide </extensions/creating-extension>`.

**2.** Send it to the project maintainers. It can be via email to any member of the Sylius Core team, or `the official Sylius Slack <https://slackinvite.me/to/sylius-devs>`_.

**3.** Wait for your Extension to be featured in :doc:`the list of extensions </extensions/list>` here in the docs and on the Sylius website.
