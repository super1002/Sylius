The Sylius API
==============

.. warning::

    The new, unified Sylius API is still under development.

We have decided that we should rebuild our API and use API Platform to build a truly mature, multi-purpose API
which can define a new standard for headless e-commerce backends.

We will be supporting API Platform out-of-the-box. Secondly, it means that both APIs will be deprecated. We are not
dropping them right now, but they will not receive further development. In the later phase, we should provide
an upgrade path for currently working apps. Last, but not least, you can already tracktrace our progress. All the PRâ€™s
will be aggregated `in this issue <https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/issues/11250>`_ and the documentation can be already found
`here <http://master.demo.sylius.com/new-api/docs>`_.

Authorization
-------------

All admin routes are protected by JWT authentication. If you would like to test these endpoints
`in our Swagger UI docs <http://master.demo.sylius.com/new-api/docs>`_, you need to retrieve a JWT token firstly.
You could do that by using an endpoint with default credentials for API administrators:

    :align: center
    :scale: 50%

|

In the response you will get a token that need to be passed in each request header. In the Swagger UI, you can set
the authentication token for each request.

    :align: center
    :scale: 50%

Notice the **Authorize** button and unlocked padlock near the available URLs:

.. image:: ../_images/sylius_api/api_platform_not_authorized.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 50%

|

Click the **Authorize** button and put the authentication token (remember about the ``Bearer`` prefix):

.. image:: ../_images/sylius_api/api_platform_authorization.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 50%

|

After clicking **Authorize**, you should see locked padlock near URLs and the proper header should be added to each API call:

The Admin API
-------------

This part of the documentation is about the old Admin API for the Sylius platform.
