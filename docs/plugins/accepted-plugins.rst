How to have a Plugin accepted by Sylius?
----------------------------------------

Since Sylius is an open-source platform, there is a certain flow in order for the plugin to become officially adopted by the community.

**1.** Develop the plugin using :doc:`the official Plugin Development guide </plugins/creating-plugin>`.

**2.** Remember about the tests and code quality!

**3.** Send it to the project maintainers. It can be via email to any member of the Sylius Core team, or `the official Sylius Slack <http://sylius.com/slack>`_.

**4.** Wait for your Plugin to be featured in `the list of plugins <http://sylius.com/developers/store/plugins>`_ on the Sylius website.
