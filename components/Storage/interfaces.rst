StorageInterface
----------------

The storage interface consists of four methods which need to be implemented in a custom storage
and already are in the default ones.

Methods include all basic operations you could use on a container, so you can either **add**, **retrieve**,
**remove** or **check** if the container has specific data.

.. tip::
   Any custom storage needs to implement this interface.
